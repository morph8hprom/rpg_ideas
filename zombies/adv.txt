ADVENTURE START
---------------

The party is having a good time celebrating (Clay Sheppard's) promotion.
There's plenty of booze, good food, and good smoke to go around.
Garbled audio from the television is barely audible under the loud music
thumping through the excessive home stereo in the living room.

WITS CHECK TN 12

SUCCESS
----------
The low drone of advertising jingles is abruptly replaced by a an obnoxious alarm-like noise,
and the television volume escalates slightly.  A robotic voice breaks through the alarm sound
and begins a warning, advising all citizens to remain inside of their homes or other shelter.
This is quite curious considering the weather has been exceptionally nice the whole day.
You attempt to hear more but the thumping bass grows even louder and drowns out any noise on the television

FAILURE
---------
An obnoxious alarm-like noise begins droning out of the television, and it's not mixing very well
with the current music selection.  Clay grabs the remote from the counter and mashes the power button.
He switches remotes for the one controlling the stereo and holds a beer up to the sky as if making a toast.
Instead he just yells "Fuck yeah!" in a partial slur and cranks the volume on the stereo up even louder.
